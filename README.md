Improved Contact-Form
============
Working Bootstrap Contact Form With PHP - Improved!

This is a fork of The BootstrapBay [Contact-Form](https://github.com/bootstrapbay/contact-form) with a few noticable improvements.

#### Improvements
1. Dynamic Captcha: always presenting a different problem.
2. There is a BotTrap checkbox for added spam protection/suppression
3. Set page title easily with a custom variable

#### Bug-fixes

1. Code re-rewritten to solve "undefined index" and "undefined variable" errors
2. Email "from" address is now working and adjustable from within the script

#### NOTE: You need a working mail server in order to use this form. Try [ssmtp](http://packages.ubuntu.com/xenial/ssmtp), which is easy to [set up](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EmailAlerts), if you do not want to host your own.
